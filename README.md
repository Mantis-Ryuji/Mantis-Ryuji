## 🔍 About Me

I'm a master's student at Kyoto University, researching the long-term degradation of wood over centuries. <br>
I'm also interested in machine learning, especially deep learning for image-related tasks, and currently studying it.

## 🚀 About My Repositories

- ### [`Playground`](https://github.com/Mantis-Ryuji/Playground)  
  A collection of my study logs and experiments. (Written in Japanease) <br>
  Mainly focused on deep learning for image-related tasks.

- ### [`Wood_Degradation_Color`](https://github.com/Mantis-Ryuji/Wood_Degradation_Color)  
  An analysis of color changes from the surface to the interior of wood due to degradation.  
  This project is based on the research I conducted during my fourth year (B4) as an undergraduate student.

- ### [`Wood_Degradation_NIR`]
  Research on wood degradation using near-infrared (NIR) spectra.  <br>
  I'm also exploring the application of deep learning to this analysis. <br>
  This repository will contain the core of my master’s research. **(Coming soon)**
